# My Awesome Project
This is a fullstack web application that allows you to check NBA stats using the public Ball Don't Lie API.

**Link to project:** https://check-the-stats.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, Node, Express, Heroku 

My focus with this project was showing my ability to create a fullstack web application from scratch. In comparison to previous projects, I focused less on the design aspect and more on displaying my knowledge of client-side and backend JavaScript. I used nested promises to take the player ID from one fetch and feed it into the second fetch that had the parameters of season and the specific statistic. The Node.js environment with Express was used for backend development. I used Heroku to host my app. The logo was created using Figma.

## Optimizations
If I would like to build on this app, I would add the opponent teams to the results table. Currently, the data from the fetches only provides team id numbers and I will need to use an array search to match the id to team name. I have created the key array so that it can be done at a later date. As this was a simple app, I did not focus on eye-catching design. If I decide to improve on this app, I will use SASS for frontend development. 

## Lessons Learned:

File Structure. Using Node.js and Express really showed the importance of correct file structure in order for the application to be fully functioning. This project allowed me to review best pratcices for file structure during development.
